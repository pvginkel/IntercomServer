## Working practices

Commit as you go along. When working through a larger task, make small, self-contained commits at each meaningful, working checkpoint (a phase, a feature, a passing build) rather than saving everything for one big commit at the end. Each commit should build and leave the tree in a coherent state. Keep messages focused on the "why".

## Federated architecture model

We take part in a federated Architecture-as-Code model. The architecture for this repository is maintained in `docs/architecture/architecture.yaml`. Whenever a change is made in this repo that could impact an Enterprise Architecture / ArchiMate model modeling everything owned by this repo, nudge the user to spawn the `update-architecture` agent. The agent is incremental, so it's not a hard requirement that it runs on every change. Nudge a bit harder when significant changes are made (new managed host, new daemon, removed service, renamed external identity). When you are performing work unattended, feel free to invoke the agent yourself.

The tooling is installed on the operator's filesystem (not in this repo): the `/seed-architecture` skill (one-shot, authors the first artifact) and the `update-architecture` agent (permanent, incremental). Generated producers — those whose `docs/architecture/*.yaml` is a build output from a generator + annotation layer — use the `update-architecture-generated` agent instead, which edits the annotations and never the output. The producer manual at `~/.claude/architecture/producer-manual.md` is the authoritative vocabulary reference; the skill and agents read it from the operator's filesystem on startup.
